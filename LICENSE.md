## Redistribution

You are obviously free to take inspiration from the source code, if anything can help you in your Godot project.

The repository comes with the game's assets and a .apk release file, in ordrer for you to be able to check the project's structure in the Godot Engine Editor, or directly test the game on an Android device :
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REDISTRIBUTE OR USE THE GAME'S APK AND ITS ASSETS.

Hope you'll enjoy it :) !
